# Prepare USD Scene from Marble World

This repository documents how to create a custom world using **Marble**, export the assets, and convert Gaussian splats (`.ply`) into **USDZ** format using **NVIDIA 3DGrut**.

---

## 1. Create a World in Marble

Visit the **Marble platform**:  
https://marble.worldlabs.ai/

Follow the on-screen instructions to generate your custom world model. Once you are satisfied with the result, download the following files:

- Splats file (`.ply`)
- High-quality mesh (`.glb`)

> **Tip (Credit Optimization):**  
> For best results, use a high-resolution **16:9** image.  
> It is recommended to refine and finalize the **panorama** before generating the full world.  
> Editing the panorama is significantly cheaper than regenerating the world after creation.

## 2. Convert Splats (PLY) to USDZ

We use **NVIDIA 3DGrut** to convert Gaussian splat data from **PLY** format into **USDZ**.

---

### 2.1 Install 3DGrut

Clone and install **3DGrut** from the official repository:

https://github.com/nv-tlabs/3dgrut

Follow the installation instructions provided in the repository.

> **Note (RTX 50-Series GPUs):**  
> If you encounter installation issues on RTX 50-series GPUs, see:  
> https://github.com/nv-tlabs/3dgrut/issues/167

---

### 2.2 Convert PLY to USDZ

If you have existing Gaussian splat data in **PLY format** (for example, generated by 3DGS), run the following command:

```bash
python -m threedgrut.export.scripts.ply_to_usd path/to/your/model.ply \
    --output_file path/to/output.usdz
